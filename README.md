### Repository of Ruby Scripts

This repository contains several Ruby scripts for solving coding problems.

#### Scripts
- `all_to_one.rb`: Given an array of integers, returns an array where each element is the product of all the elements of the input array except for the element at the current index.
- `high_three.rb`: Given an array of integers, returns the highest possible product of three elements from the array.
- `road.rb`: Given a set of gas stations along a road with distances between them and the amount of gas available at each station, finds the minimum number of refueling stops required to travel the entire distance.
- `rotation_finder.rb`: Given an array of strings, finds the index of the element where the alphabetic order changes (i.e., the first element after a rotation).

#### Testing
RSpec is used for testing. The tests for each script can be found in the corresponding `_spec.rb` file in the `spec` directory.
